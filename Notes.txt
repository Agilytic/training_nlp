Structure & ReadMe very clear
Number of model tested and perf measures chosen and automatic selection
Venv/requirement
Good model performance
Code well written (if name=main) and well documented, well annoted
Feature selection
Extensive plot
Extensive data processing
- Confusion around 'best model' and plots -> which model is deployed? GMB? GLM? H2O?-> guessing H20 from perf but should be in readme
- Set up venv bit challenging
- Model choice tend to overfitting, none of the selection measure can help spot it (ROC curve, accuracy thereshold curbe)
Next steps
- more clearly define import fucntion for readability import dataReading/from Utils import dataReading
- Go further with text feature creation (LDA, Word2Vec...)
- Average vs distribution
